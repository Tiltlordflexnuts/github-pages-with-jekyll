Today is an incredible day, filled with information pulling me in every direction. I still have  no idea what I'm doing in the
coding world but, having a slightly better grasp than the day before feels nice. Each day seems to be a small step up the overwhelming mountain.
One step at a time is all that can be taken and is the utmost priority, even over every step thereafter. One step. Everyday.
